Intelligent Transportation System with Wireless Sensor Networks

This project is designed to create an intelligent transportation system by exploiting low cost wireless sensor motes for the lecture ’Wireless Sensor Network Laboratory’. The wireless network is constructed with the help of Destination-Sequenced Distance Vector(DSDV) routing algorithm to maintain multi-hop and loop-free communication. The network consists of Road Side Units(RSUs) and Mobile Units(MUs) which equipped with IR-distance sensor and force sensor respectively. RSUs provide information about traffic condition on the road and maintain a communication channel between MU and traffic center in the case of emergency. Moreover, the network traffic and emergency conditions can be tracked by the GUI.

The `src` folder includes the codes which run for MUs and RSUs seperately. The `gui` folder contains the source code to launch the Qt5 GUI application window.
